Yoti Software Developer in Test assignment
==========================================

## Introduction

You will test a service that navigates a imaginary robotic hoover (much like a [Roomba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roomba)) 
through an equally imaginary room based on:

* room dimensions as [X and Y coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), identifying the top right corner of the room rectangle. This room is divided up in a grid based on these dimensions; a room that has dimensions X: 5 and Y: 5 has 5 columns and 5 rows, so 25 possible hoover positions. The bottom left corner is the point of origin for our coordinate system, so as the room contains all coordinates its bottom left corner is defined by X: 0 and Y: 0.
* locations of patches of dirt, also defined by X and Y coordinates identifying the bottom left corner of those grid positions.
* an initial hoover position (X and Y coordinates like patches of dirt)
* driving instructions (as [cardinal directions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction) where e.g. N and E mean "go north" and "go east" respectively) 

The room will be rectangular, has no obstacles (except the room walls), no doors and all locations in the room will be clean (hoovering has no effect) except for the locations of the patches of dirt presented in the program input.

Placing the hoover on a patch of dirt ("hoovering") removes the patch of dirt so that patch is then clean for the remainder of the program run. The hoover is always on - there is no need to enable it.

Driving into a wall has no effect (the robot skids in place).

## Goal

The goal of the service is to take the room dimensions, the locations of the dirt patches, the hoover location and the driving instructions as input and to then output the following:

* The final hoover position (X, Y)
* The number of patches of dirt the robot cleaned up

Your goal is to verify whether the provided implementation behaves according to specification.

## Service specification

### Input

Program input will be received in a json payload with the format described here.

Example:

```javascript
{
  "roomSize" : [5, 5],
  "coords" : [1, 2],
  "patches" : [
    [1, 0],
    [2, 2],
    [2, 3]
  ],
  "instructions" : "NNESEESWNWW"
}
```

## Output

Service output is returned as a json payload.

Example (matching the input above):

```javascript
{
  "coords" : [1, 3],
  "patches" : 1
}
```
Where `coords` are the final coordinates of the hoover and `patches` is the number of cleaned patches.

## Deliverable

The test suite:

* is implemented using any Java BDD framework (e.g. Cucumber or JBehave)
* must run on Mac OS X or Linux (x86-64) 
* can make use of any existing open source libraries that don't directly address the problem statement (use your best judgement).

Send us:

* The full source code, including any code written which is not part of the normal program run (e.g. scripts)
* Clear instructions on how to obtain and run the test suite
* A short report of the bugs that were detected (if any)
* Please provide any deliverable and instructions using a public Github (or similar) Repository as several people will need to inspect the solution

## Evaluation

The point of the exercise is for us to see: 

- How you approach API testing
- How you structure your tests
- How you explain the approach you took and the assumptions you made
- How you deal with uncertainty and contribute to requirements specification 
- How experienced you are at spotting nasty bugs!  

We will especially consider:

* Code organisation
* Code readability 
* Quality of instructions
* Quality of the report
* Percentage of the detected bugs

## How to execute the service to test
### Requirements
- Docker v.18+

### Building the service
From the root of this repository, run the following:
- `sudo chmod +x service/run.sh`
- `docker build -t yoti-sdet-assignment service`

### Running the service
- `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name yoti-sdet-assignment yoti-sdet-assignment`

### Hitting the endpoint
You can test whether the service is running correctly by executing the following command:
- `curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{ "roomSize" : [5, 5], "coords" : [1, 2], "patches" : [ [1, 0], [2, 2], [2, 3] ], "instructions" : "NNESEESWNWW" }' http://localhost:8080/v1/cleaning-sessions`
